With Status charts, you can now visualize live equipment status as a grid, or view historical status as a timeline simply by configuring conditional thresholds using \u003c, \u003e, ≤, ≥, and = operators and assigning colors to the thresholds. For example, for a temperature sensor, you can define a temperature value greater than, say, 80° F as “RED” and anything less than or equals to 80° F as “GREEN” so that you can easily visualize whether the temperature is currently RED (above 80° F) or GREEN (less than or equals to 80° F), or when the temperature has been GREEN and RED over a period of time in the past.  AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor now supports Scatter charts , a chart type that helps customers visualize distinct data points (without connecting lines) for live and historical operational data. With Scatter charts, you can look for any correlations between the measured values over a period of time. Scatter charts provide a cleaner visualization of the overall spread of operational data from processes, devices, and equipment plotted against time. Scatter charts also help with visualizing and comparing sensor data and manually-ingested data in the same chart in SiteWise.  AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor now supports Trend lines , a linear regression line that best approximates the relationship between measured data and time. With Trend lines, you can now intuitively identify gradual shifts and changes in your live and historical data simply by adding trend lines to any of your Line, Scatter, and Bar charts. For example, in a windfarm, if you see a gradual decline in the power output trend line from a wind turbine while there is a flat and steady wind speed trend line, you can easily identify a power conversion efficiency issue with the wind turbine and immediately deploy field technicians to inspect and troubleshoot the wind turbine."}

{"title":"Application and Classic Load Balancers are adding defense in depth with the introduction of Desync Mitigation Mode","date":"2020-08-17T00:00:00Z","desc":"Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Classic Load Balancer (CLB) now support HTTP Desync Mitigation Mode, a new feature that protects your application from issues due to HTTP Desync. Modern day web applications are typically built with a chain of proxies that ensure fast and reliable communication between clients and servers. While these proxies follow a standard mechanism to parse RFC 7230 compliant HTTP/1.1 requests, they may have differences in interpretation while parsing non-compliant requests. These differences in interpretation can cause Desync where different proxies in the chain may disagree on request boundaries and therefore may not process the same request. This could leave behind arbitrary messages that may be prepended to the next request in the queue and smuggled to the backend. Ultimately, request smuggling can make applications vulnerable to request queue or cache poisoning, which could lead to credential hijacking or execution of unauthorized commands. "}

{"title":"AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate Now Supports Custom Domains","date":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","desc":"AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate now supports custom domains. Through the existing interfaces you can now provide a custom fully qualified domain name (FQDN), its matching SSL certificate, and SSL private key and have the OpsWorks server configured accordingly. After you have created a Canonical Name (CNAME) entry in your DNS management service to point to the internal OpsWorks endpoint, you will find your Chef Automate Dashboard under a domain of your choice instead of the generic OpsWorks-created one. Also, this will now be the public endpoint of your OpsWorks server. By using a custom domain with an SSL certificate that you manage, you have an endpoint that stays the same regardless of the server being re-created: any node under management by the OpsWorks for Chef Automate server will stay associated through this endpoint.  If you already have an OpsWorks server in use and want to use your own domain, you will first need to create a backup of your OpsWorks server through the CreateBackup API. You then create a new server from the backup through a CreateServer API call, where you provide the backup id together with the three new input parameters: custom domain, custom certificate and custom private key. This will bring your OpsWorks server up with its public endpoint being the custom domain you specified. As with new servers, you will need to create a CNAME entry in your DNS management service of choice to point to the internal OpsWorks endpoint. For more details on this process, please see our documentation . Here you will also find information about which types of certificates can be used and what to do when the certificate is about to expire.  Should you be new to OpsWorks for Chef Automate and curious to experience it, it is easy to get started. By following this Getting Started walk-through, you can within 15 minutes be up and running with your first node managed by Chef Automate."}
